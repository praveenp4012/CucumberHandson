Cucumber-BDD Framework:
	Feature file
		Contains Gherkin keywords
		Scenario/Scenario Outline
	Step Definition file
		Selenium Code
		Java code/Annotations
	Test Runner
		To run the feature file and the corresponding Step definition file
		To generate the reports

===========================================
Cucumber Options:
	features ==> We mention the feature file location here
	glue ==> We mention the step definition file location here
	format ==> To get proper html and json reports
	dryRun
		> If true ==> Gives the missing snippets of step definitions for all feature file steps
				  ==> Code will not be executed i.e. all are skipped
				  ==> No Errors in JUNIT reports for missing step definitions
				  
		> If false ==> Still gives the missing snippets of step definitions for all feature file steps
				  ==> Code will be executed by skipping the missing step definitions
	
	monochrome ==> if TRUE, displays console output in a proper readable format
	strict 
		> If true ==> It strictly checkes for the missing step definitions 
				      and fails the testcases incase of missing and also informs the missing snippets
		> If false ==> Just passes the testcases and informs incase of missing step definitions
	tags ==> Used to execute the testcases of our wish
		= {"@smoketest"} ==> Executes only those testcases which have "smoketest" as the tag in the feature file
		= {"@regressiontest"} ==> Executes only those testcases which have "regressiontest" as the tag in the feature file
		= {"@smoketest , @regressiontest"} ==> Executes only those testcases which have either "smoketest" or "regressiontest" 
												or both as the tag in the feature file
		= {"@smoketest" , "@regressiontest"} ==> Executes only those testcases which have both "smoketest" and "regressiontest" 
		= {"~@smoketest"} ==> Executes all the testcases by ignoring "smoketest" tagged testcases
		= {"~@smoketest", "~@regressiontest"} ==> Executes all the testcases by ignoring "smoketest" and "regressiontest" tagged testcases
		
===========================================
Data driven testing using Cucumber:
	> Simple Data driven - Without Examples keyword == Regular Expression - \"(.*)\" OR \"([^\"]*)\"
	> Data driven - With Example keyword == Regular Expression - \"(.*)\" OR \"([^\"]*)\" 
		If we use Examples keyword, Use "Scenario Outline" instead of "Scenario" in the feature file
	> Using Data table == Can be achieved by both List and Maps and with the class "DataTable"

Hooks:
	> Hooks are used to define the pre and post conditions in cucumber
	
Tagged Hooks:
	> Execute hooks based on tags
